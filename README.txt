The Easy Breadcrumb module provides configurable breadcrumbs which improve on
core breadcrumbs by including the current page t itle as an unlinked crumb which
follows breadcrumb best-practices. Easy Breadcrumb takes
advantage of the work you've already done for generating your paths' alias,
while it naturally encourages the creation of semantic and consistent paths.
This modules is currently available for Drupal 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x.x.

Easy Breadcrumb uses the current URL (path alias) and the current page's title
to automatically extract the breadcrumb's segments and its respective links.
The module is really a plug and play module because it auto-generates the
breadcrumb by using the current URL and nothing extra is needed.

For example, having an URL like "gallery/videos/once-a-time-in-cartagena",
EasyBreadcrumb will automatically produces the breadcrumb
"Home >> Gallery >> Videos >> Once a time in Cartagena" or
"Home >> Videos >> Once a Time in Cartagena". Again, the breadcrumb presentation
will vary depending on your module's settings.
