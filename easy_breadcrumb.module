 * The Easy Breadcrumb module provides a block to be embedded in any page,
 * typically at some place near the page's header.
 * Easy Breadcrumb uses the URL (path alias) and the current page's title
 * (when available) to obtain the breadcrumb's segments and its respective
 * links. The resulting block will be something like:
 * "Home >> Contact Us" or "Home / Contact us".
 * Such presentation could vary depending on the configuration of the module.
