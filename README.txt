The Easy Breadcrumb module provides a plug-and-play breadcrumb block to be
embedded in your pages, typically at some place near the page's header.

Easy Breadcrumb uses the current URL (path alias) and the current page's title
to automatically extract the breadcrumb's segments and its respective links.
Easy Breadcrumb is really a plug and play module, it auto-generates the
breadcrumb by using the current URL, the user needs to do anything to get it
working. The resulting block will be something like: "Home >> Contact Us" or
"Home / Contact us". The breadcrumb presentation could vary depending on the
module's settings.
